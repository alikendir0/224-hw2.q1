The Directed graph shown below. From using this graph and HW2_Q1_text text file, write a code 
that take the starting point, and show two step forward like sample output. In the question test the 
starting point as 0,2, and 4. In the question you create 4 java document and 1 text file: 
- DirectGraph: Create direct graph
- FileRead: read the text file.
- HW2_solution: main program
- Valuefinder: take the value of txt file and convert the integer.
